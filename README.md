Welcome to IT Startup Game!

You start your game on 01/01/2020.
```
Every day you can do just one of eight things:
 1 - sign contract to make a project
 2 - look for new projects
 3 - program all day 
 4 - test code you wrote all day
 5 - give finished project to your customer 
 6 - hire new employee 
 7 - lay off employee 
 8 - spend your day doing accounting 
 ```
 By selecting 9 you can always check your statistics.
 
 * There are three types of customers. You don't want to make a project for the one of them, because if you give back non working project - there is a chance customer won't pay you anything!
 
 * You can hire four types of employees: 
    * Testers - having one tester per three programmers guarantees you won't give back project that isn't working.
    * Programmers - every programmer has different skills, they help you with projects from monday to friday.
    * Sales - sales person is looking for new projects you can sign, so you don't have to.
    * Freelancers - when you hire a freelancer they will only work for you for 30 days.
 
 * Hiring and getting rid of employees costs some money.
 
 * You need to spend at least 2 days per month on accounting. If you don't , you lose!
 
 * Every five days you spent on looking for new projects, new project will be made available for you.
 
 * To win you have to finish at least 3 projects (and get paid for them). One of the three has to be found by your Sales. You also have to have more money on your account than when you first started.
